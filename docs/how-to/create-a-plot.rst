Create a Plot
===============

To create plot from the model, we call the method ``plot``, and
pass in the axes limits, along with the resolution of the plot we
want. To plot a fractal for the range -2, 2 and
-2.5 , 2.5 for x and y-axis respectively and of resolution (200,300)::

    >>>model.plot(-2, 2, -2.5, 2.5, (200,300))

This creates a plot:
