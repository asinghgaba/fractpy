Tutorial: Generating Newton Fractal for a simple function
=========================================================

Introduction to Fractal
-----------------------

A fractal is never ending pattern. Fractals are a type of mathematical 
shape that are infinitely complex. They are created by repeating a 
simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. 

In essence, a Fractal is a pattern that repeats forever, and every part
of the Fractal, regardless of how zoomed in, or zoomed out you are, it
looks very similar to the whole image. A shape does not have to be
exactly identical to be classified as a Fractal. Instead shapes that
display inherent and repeating similarities are the main requirement
for being classified as a Fractal.

Here is an animation [Mandelbrot2010]_ representing the Mandelbrot Set
Fractal one of the most iconic math fractals:

Newton Fractal
++++++++++++++

One way of generating fractals is using Newton-Raphson Method, also known
as Newton Fractal. Newton fractals are fractals created in the plane of
complex numbers. An iteration process with Newtonâ€™s method is started at
each point on a grid in the complex plane, and a color is assigned to each
point according to which of the roots of a given function the iteration
converges to.

A generalisation of Newton's iteration is:

.. math::

    z_{n+1} = z_n - \frac{f(z_n)}{f'(z_n)}

where :math:`z \in \mathbb{C}` represents any point in the plane,
:math:`n \in \mathbb{N}` represents the number of step, and
:math:`f(z)` is a polynomial or transcendental function.

For :math:`f(z) = z^3 - 1`, the iteration is:

.. math::

    z_{n+1} = z_n - \frac{z^3 - 1}{3z^2}

Let us now see how to plot fractal for this function using ``fractpy``.

Using FractPy
-------------

Generating fractals in ``fractypy`` can be divided into 2 steps:

1. Creating a model
   
2. Generating the fractal


Creating a Model
++++++++++++++++
A model represents the technique being used to generate the fractal,
so generating fractal from Newtons' method would involve making a
model ``NewtonFractal`` which is a class of module ``fractpy.models``,
and then passing the required function in the form ``str`` as an
argument during initialisation. The following code shows how to
make a ``NewtonFractal`` model for the above function::

    >>>from fractpy.models import NewtonFractal
    >>>model = NewtonFractal("x**3 - 1")
    >>>model
    ### FractPy Model ###
    Type: Newton Fractal
    Function: x**3 - 1

.. note::
    For complex values use **I** (upper case i) instead of commonly used
    convention of **i**. For example: function
    :math:`f(x) = (x - 1)(x + i)(x - i)` would be passed as
    ``"(x - 1)(x + I)(x - I)"``.

Generating Fractal
++++++++++++++++++
To generate the fractal all we have to do now is call the method ``plot``,
and pass in the axes limits along with the desired resolution of the
image::

    >>>xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax = -2, 2, -2, 2
    >>>model.plot(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, (200, 200))

The above code will generate the Newton Fractal for :math:`x^3 - 1`, in the range
-2 to 2 for both x-axis and y-axis, and the resolution of the image would be
200X200.

This creates the following plot:

.. note::
    Generating fractal requires some heavy computation so it may take seconds,
    or minutes depending on the computing power of the system.
